# CQRS-Rx

My take on a simple .NET Standard 2.0 CQRS library leveraging Reactive Extensions (Rx)

The following codebase is based on the previous work provided by:

- [Meanwhile... on the command side of my architecture](https://cuttingedge.it/blogs/steven/pivot/entry.php?id=91)
- [CQRS : A Cross Examination Of How It Works](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/991648/cqrs-a-cross-examination-of-how-it-works)
- [Rx works nicely with DDD and Event Sourcing](https://abdullin.com/post/rx-works-nicely-with-ddd-and-event-sourcing/)
- [Simple CQRS example](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r)
- [CQRSlite](https://github.com/gautema/CQRSlite)

__DISCLAIMER__: This project has no intention of becoming a CQRS framework and it's only purpose is to be a tool of learning.
